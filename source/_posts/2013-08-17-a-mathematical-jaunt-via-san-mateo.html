<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"> <p>The other day some colleagues and I drove into downtown San Mateo for lunch.  An interesting decision had to be made: how many quarters to pay the meter. </p> <p>The price for parking is $0.25 per half hour. Your penny-pinching instincts suggest to only put in 2 quarters.  Let's say that a parking ticket for going over the meter is $40.</p> <h1 id="breakingdownthescenario">Breaking Down the Scenario</h1> <p>Let's apply a little reasoning and mathematics to this, situation and see what's the right amount of quarters to put into the meter.</p> <p>There are 5 possible outcomes:</p> <ol><li>pay $0.50, go under one hour, no ticket: total price $0.50</li><li>pay $0.50, go over one hour, no ticket: total price $0.50</li><li>pay $0.50, go over one hour, get ticket: total price $40.50</li><li>pay $0.75, go under one hour, no ticket: total price $0.75</li><li>pay $0.75, go over one hour, no ticket: total price $0.75</li></ol> <h1 id="conservativeguesstimates">Conservative Guesstimates</h1> <p>Now the fun part.  Let's assign rough guesstimates of likelihood for each outcome.</p> <p>Let's be generous and say that you only go over one hour 20% of the time, and only 20% of the times you go over do you get a ticket.</p> <p>Let's also say that you pay $0.50 half the time and $0.75 half the time.</p> <ol><li>40% probability x $0.50 = $0.20</li><li>8% probability x $0.50 = $0.04</li><li>2% probability x $40.50 = $0.81</li><li>40% probability x $0.75 = $0.30</li><li>10% probability x $0.75 = $0.075</li></ol> <p>Computed average cost: $1.425</p> <p>Even at the conservative rate of ticketing of 20% of time you go over an hour, you still increase your expected rate of pay to almost double, by choosing to pay $0.50 half the time!</p> <h1 id="withvigilantmetermaids">With Vigilant Meter Maids</h1> <p>If instead you think you'll get a ticket 75% of the time you go over, the average cost per park becomes a whopping $3.625</p> <ol><li>40% probability x $0.50 = $0.20</li><li>2.5% probability x $0.50 = $0.0125</li><li>7.5% probability x $40.50 = $3.0375</li><li>40% probability x $0.75 = $0.30</li><li>10% probability x $0.75 = $0.075</li></ol> <p>Computed average cost: $3.625</p> <p>So it looks like in general it pays to be safe and pay the extra quarter when parking in downtown San Mateo.</p> <h1 id="furtherprecision">Further Precision</h1> <p>We could expand this further, by considering likelihoods of lunch going over 1.5 hours.  I didn't because I think there's diminishing returns on investment because the odds of going over 1.5 hours are probably only like 20% of 20% => 4%...  I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader :)</p> <br /></div></div>
